Icon source files are in the Xara Xtreme format. Some icons are modified
versions of the BSD-licensed icon set found here:

http://svgicons.sourceforge.net/

After modifying an icon, make sure to export it to a corresponding .gif file
for use by Countershape. The .gif files are also checked into the repository,
to make it easy for people without Xara Xtreme.
