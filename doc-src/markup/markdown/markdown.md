Use a page filename with the file extension ".md" or from the referencing index.py
use:

`this.markup = "markdown"`

to render all pages in the index.py using this markup context.


[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-to-HTML

easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally 
valid XHTML (or HTML). 

Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;
and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text
formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to
Markdown s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online
