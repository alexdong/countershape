# Introduction

<blockquote><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>  is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write
plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;
and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text
formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to
Markdown s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online

# Countershape Support

As evident from this page, not all features of Markdown is supported. The <a href="markdown/basics.html">Basic</a> and <a href="markdown/syntax.html">Syntax</a>
pages exposes how countershape converts the 'published' markdown syntax as per 2009.11.05

The <a href="markdown/basics.html">Basic</a>  page require no changes from the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text">original markdown text</a>.

The <a href="markdown/syntax.html">Syntax</a> page requires some changes from the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">original markdown text</a> including:

    - removing non-ascii characters
    
    - converting some &lt; symbols to their HTML Entities (e.g. &lt; becomes &amp;lt;)
    
    - converting some &amp; symbols to their HTML Entities (e.g. &amp; becomes &amp;amp;)
