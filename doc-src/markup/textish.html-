    Textish operates as follows:

        - First, the text is "de-dented" by trimming an amount of space equal
          to the smallest indent of any line from the left of each line.
        - Then, the following transformations are performed:

                Paragraph:

                    Any block of text is wrapped in <p> </p> tags. A block of
                    text is any contiguous set of lines (where HTML block tags
                    are considered to be a single "unit", regardless of
                    contained newlines). That means that:

                            "This is a single paragraph..."

                            "...and so is this <div>

                            something

                            <div>"

                            "but this is two paragraphs..

                            <div>something</div>"

                Heading:

                    H1 Heading
                    ==========

                    H2 Heading
                    ----------

                    : H1 Heading
                    ------------

                    ::::: H5 Heading
                    ----------------
                    
                    These are wrapped in <hX> tags where the X depends on the
                    number of leading colons. 


                UL Lists

                    * This is a UL list item.
                    * So is this.
                    
                    * And so is this. List items
                      can span multiple lines.

                    Nested lists are not currently supported. If any list item
                    in a list is separated from the rest of the list by a blank
                    line, all items are wrapped in a P tag.

                Emphasis:

                    _emphasis_ -> <em>emphasis</em>
                    __strong__  -> <strong>strong</strong>


                Footnotes:

                    This is a footnote[1]. This is a footnote[this can be any
                    text]. 

                    [1] And here is where it is defined.
                    [this can be any text] And here is where it is defined.

                    All footnotes are collected together at the end of the
                    document output. 

        - The markup transformations shown above are NOT performed inside HTML
          block elements. Quotes, code blocks, etc. are therefore done just as
          they are in a straight HTML document.
