:: Overview
----------------

    Writing is for humans, text processing is for computers. Let writers espouse with ease, 
    but if they must tweak the presentation then make it eminently simple

    Somewhere along life's path, people realised that all these tags being used for mark-up 
    were all well and fine for autonomas, and their public servants, but frankly not good for 
    mere humans. A long line of humanoids attempted to cut down the SGML markup 
    language, starting with the first truely successful cut-down called HTML, which was 
    later bastardised by technoids and industry to something called XML.

    Textish converts simple text files, and marked up text files to beautified HTML.
    Textish is a text mark-up syntax processed by countershape

    Textish is our path to zen and simplicity. When all else fails, remember it's about the 
    maintainability of our text, and _if you must use HTML_, `__Just Do It__`.

:: Textish
--------------

There are some mark-ups that we need, whether it's documented somewhere is another matter all together.
Herein lays dormant some of the things that textish supports, and doesn't support. Have problem? fix it.

:: Block Elements
=====

	Text is usually broken up into large segments which we generally term "Blocks." Organising text into blocks usually includes the following, which are dealt here in a little more detail.

* Paragraphs and Line Breaks
* Heading Levels
* Blockquotes
* Lists
* Code Blocks
* Horizontal Rules

::: Paragraphs and Line Breaks
--------------------------------------------

	Any block of text is wrapped in &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags. A block of
	text is any contiguous set of lines (where HTML block tags
	are considered to be a single "unit", regardless of
	contained newlines).

	This means that a paragraph is any number of lines of text, 
     separated by at least one empty line. That means that:

	:::: This is a single paragraph
    ----------------------------------
    
    <pre class="highlight">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
    Duis vel nulla sit amet neque sollicitudin dictum quis eu leo. 
    Aenean non dui libero. Phasellus molestie, lorem sit amet 
    scelerisque pellentesque, ligula orci pulvinar lectus, at sagittis 
    diam erat sit amet libero.
    </pre>

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
    Duis vel nulla sit amet neque sollicitudin dictum quis eu leo. 
    Aenean non dui libero. Phasellus molestie, lorem sit amet 
    scelerisque pellentesque, ligula orci pulvinar lectus, at sagittis 
    diam erat sit amet libero.
    
	:::: But this is two paragraphs
    ----------------------------------

    Using embedded HTML block markup.(note use of &lt;div&gt; and &lt;/div&gt;)

    <pre class="highlight">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
&lt;div&gt;Duis vel nulla sit amet neque sollicitudin dictum quis eu leo. 
Aenean non dui libero. Phasellus molestie, lorem sit amet 
scelerisque pellentesque, ligula orci pulvinar lectus, at sagittis 
diam erat sit amet libero.&lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
    <div>Duis vel nulla sit amet neque sollicitudin dictum quis eu leo. 
    Aenean non dui libero. Phasellus molestie, lorem sit amet 
    scelerisque pellentesque, ligula orci pulvinar lectus, at sagittis 
    diam erat sit amet libero.</div>

	:::: And this is two paragraphs
    ----------------------------------
    
    Using the traditional separation of text blocks with an empty/blank line
    
    <pre class="highlight">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
Duis vel nulla sit amet neque sollicitudin dictum quis eu leo. 
Aenean non dui libero. Phasellus molestie, lorem sit amet 
scelerisque pellentesque, ligula orci pulvinar lectus, at sagittis 
diam erat sit amet libero. 

<br>

Vestibulum tincidunt porttitor nisi, 
sit amet fringilla dui iaculis a. In tellus nisi, mollis vitae blandit non, 
tincidunt non augue. Etiam ultrices, libero a ullamcorper dignissim, 
tortor justo vulputate mauris, in posuere neque ligula vitae nibh. 
Proin tristique urna non turpis aliquam ultrices.
    </pre>

    tortor justo vulputate mauris, in posuere neque ligula vitae nibh. 
    Proin tristique urna non turpis aliquam ultrices.

:: Heading Levels
--------------------------

	Heading Levels are deliniated by using a symbol line following the heading. 
    
    For example:

    - Heading Level 1 - use "==" below the line 
    
    - Heading Level 2 - use "--" below a line.

	Textish does not use the markdown hash pre-pending concept for specifying Heading Levels. 
    We support using a leading ":" colon to specify the heading level, and then supporting "---"
    
    - Heading Level 1 - use ":" to start line and "---" on the following line
        
    - Heading Level 2 - use "::" to start the line and "---" on the following line
    
    - Heading Level 3 - use ":::" to start the line and "---" on the following line

	The following sample for headings is embedded in a &lt;pre&gt; wrapper for html viewing.

    <pre class="highlight">
    : Heading Level 1
    ---
    
    </pre>
    
    : Heading Level 1
    ---
    
    <pre class="highlight">
    :: Heading Level 2
    ---
    
    </pre>
    
    :: Heading Level 2
    ---
    
    <pre class="highlight">
    ::: Heading Level 3
    ---
    
    </pre>
    
  ::: Heading Level 3
    ---
    
    :::: Heading Level 4
    ---
    
    ::::: Heading Level 5
    ---
    
    The key aspects of the Heading Levels is to ensure that there is a blank line
    above and below the heading (which obviously makes your text more legible?)

:: Sample Heading using following "--"
----------------------------------------------------

Note that using additional "--"  or "==" is not significant for the conversion process, but may be significant for readability.

By using a full line of "---" this section is as readily readable in the text version as well as the converted, marked-up version.

:: Block Quotes
-----------------------

	Blockquotes are normally marked in HTML with &lt;blockquotes&gt; something in here &lt;/blockquotes&gt;

	<pre class="highlight">
	> This is text that I want to blockquote, but I Textish doesn''t
	> yet know how to do blockquotes.
	> The markdown designation are text blocks beginning with
	></pre>

	<blockquote>&lt;blockquote&gt;
	Advantages of blockquotes include display indentation and
	potential styling through CSS.
	&lt;/blockquote&gt;</blockquote>

:: Lists
----------

Unordered Lists &lt;ul&gt; are designated by using a leading asterisk "*", minus-sign "-", or plus-sign "+".

	    * This is a UL list item.
	    - So is this.
	    + and another item

	    * And so is this. List items
	      can span multiple lines.

Ordered Lists &lt;ol&gt; are not yet supported and the below will be wrapped as &lt;P&gt; paragraphs. The following samples should indicate when support is provided for OL.

	1. This is an ordered List item

	2. This is a 2nd part of the list

Nested Lists are not yet supported and the below is only a marker incase it does work before this documentation
gets updated.

	* List Item
		*- Sub-list Item (?)
		** Sub-List Item (?)
		-- Sub-List Item (?)

:: Code Blocks
---------------------------

Code within a block of text can be deliniated by using the backtick?

`from spaceman import alien.friendly`

&lt;pre&gt;
<pre class="highlight">from spaceman import alien.friendly</pre>
&lt;/pre&gt;

:: Horizontal Rules
---------------------------
<hr />



: Character Styling
---------------------------

Textish converts text wrapped with a leading and trailing underscore as emphasis (&lt;em&gt;) and when using two leading and trailing underscores as strong aka bold (&lt;strong&gt;).

<pre>_emphasis_ </pre>

                    _This text should be emphasised, otherwise known _ (single underscore)

<pre>__strong__  </pre>
                     __Is this text strong?__ (double underscore)



                Footnotes:

                    This is a footnote[1]. This is a footnote[this can be any
                    text].

                    [1] And here is where it is defined.
                    [this can be any text] And here is where it is defined.

                    All footnotes are collected together at the end of the
                    document output.

        - The markup transformations shown above are NOT performed inside HTML
          block elements. Quotes, code blocks, etc. are therefore done just as
          they are in a straight HTML document.

: Linking
--------------

[ref: PHP Markdown: Concepts](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/concepts/)

We are currently limited to using straight HTML for links, but the markdown syntax is [square] brackets surrounding the Text for a link, with the url delimited by using standard (brackets.)

	[Text](url)

	[Text](url "Anchor Title")

	[Nullcube Web Site](http://www.nullcube.com "Go Home")

A nice feature documented in PHP Markdown, above, is the use of Reference-style links, such as:

	__[Text][reference-id]__

	__[reference-id]:url "Title Text"__

	Security is a state of purpose, not a final product [Nullcube][nc]

	[nc]:http://www.nullcube.com "Visit Nullcube's Website"

Apparently, the line that defines the URL is stripped from the output and inserted as the "a href="

:: Automatic Linking
------------------------------

Automatic links would support converting un-anchored text for their correct anchored version.

&lt;http://www.nullcube.com&gt; is converted into an anchored href, whereas

&lt;samt+riding@nullcube.com&gt; is converted into a mailto, reference.

:: Images
--------------

Images are linked with similar syntax to the above reference syntax.

![Alt Text][/path/to/image.jpg]
![Alt Text][/path/to/image.jpg "Optional Title"]
