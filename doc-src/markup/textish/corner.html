: Corner Cases
----

Cases where textish is not performing as user-expected, although it may be reasonably expected that this is 'correct-code' behaviour.

:: Text Formatting
---

Undscores within names is a frequent occurrence in filenames and configuration settings. The problem highlights itself in textish (and markdown) when multiple underscores are used on a "line."

Graphics disappear, and text are "_incorrect_".

It is (is it) indicative that processing continues within a &lt;pre&gt; block

>> This_name_Should_not << be emphasised (three underscores)

>> This_name_Should << not be emphasised (two underscores)

The following img tags use two underscores, such as hello($underscore)there($underscore)friend.png is an inbox with a down green arrow, hello($underscore)($underscore)there($underscore)($underscore)friend.png is an inbox with an outgoing yellow button.

::: Inline with text
----
<img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Well done" alt="Graphic Not Shown" />
<img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" />

::: div block - img using closing tag
---

<blockquote>
  img using a _closing tag_ <- this should not textished processed inside a pre block?

  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" />

  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" />


  img not using closing tag

  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" >

  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" >

</blockquote>

::: Pre block - img using closing tag
---

<pre>
  img using a _closing tag_ <- this should not textished processed inside a pre block?
  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" />
  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" />


  img not using closing tag
  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" >
  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" >
</pre>

::: Pre block using class=" ... " - img using closing tag
----

<pre class="highlight">
  img tag using __closing tag__ <- this should not be stronged inside a html block?
  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" />
  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" />


  img not using closing tag
  <img src="hello_there_friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got EMed?" >
  <img src="hello__there__friend.png" title="Did you find me" alt="Graphic got STRONGed?" >
</pre>

::: Compilation Problems
---

This is the scenario of not closing tags correctly.

<pre>
Pre block which is not closed correctly (i.e. has a starting block within)

Apparently __ALL__ text after this is invisible in Opera.
<code></pre>

Opera sucks!! Unrestrained Standards compliance SUCKS!!

Opera tries to render the rest 'code' fragment inside the 'pre' block, which just closed effectively making everything disappear until there's some closure?'
</code>

At which point further text re-appear magically. Another example of the failure in dogmatic, fundamentalism.
