Countershape is a compact Web 2.0 development framework.


Three big ideas
===============

    Web sites and documentation have a natural tree-like structure

    This is a paragraph of text. 


    Forms and pages are two sides of the same coin
    ----------------------------------------------

    This is a paragraph of text.



What Countershape is Not
========================    

    Another way to look at Countershape is to consider what it is not. 

    Countershape is not your ORM 
    ----------------------------

    Countershape is ORM-agnostic. It provides you with the tools to be
    super-productive whether you use SQLAlchemy, SQLObject, straight SQL or
    plain old flat text files to store your data 


    Countershape is not a programmatic code generator
    -------------------------------------------------

    Unlike many other web frameworks, Countershape does not have a
    "start-project" command that magically spews out a couple of hundred
    lines of code into a deeply-nested directory structure. Countershape is
    expressive and flexible enough to allow you to structure your project
    the way you want, without having your hand held.
