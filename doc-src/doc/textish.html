Textish is a MarkDown-inspired shorthand for producing HTML documentation. 

First, the text is "de-dented" by trimming an amount of space equal to the
smallest indent of any line from the left of each line. Next, the set of text
transformations discussed below are performed. These transformations are NOT
performed inside HTML block elements. 


Paragraphs
==========

Any block of text is wrapped in &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags. A block of text is
any contiguous set of lines and HTML blocks. HTML blocks are considered to be
"units", regardless of any whitespace they contain.

<!--(block | textish)-->
This is a paragraph...
<!--(end)-->

<!--(block | textish)-->
...and so is <div>

this

<div>
<!--(end)-->

<!--(block | textish)-->
but this is two paragraphs.

<div>something</div>"
<!--(end)-->



Headings
========

H1 and H2 headings can be created simply using double or single underlines:

<!--(block | textish)-->
H1 Heading
==========

H2 Heading
----------
<!--(end)-->

An extended heading syntax allows you to specify the heading degree precisely
with leading colons:

<!--(block | textish)-->
: H1 Heading
------------

::::: H5 Heading
----------------
<!--(end)-->



Lists
=====

<!--(block | textish)-->
* This is a item.
* So is this.

* And so is this. List items
  can span multiple lines.
<!--(end)-->

Nested lists are not currently supported. If any list item in a list is
separated from the rest of the list by a blank line, all items are wrapped in
paragraph tags.


Emphasis
========  

<!--(block | textish)-->
Text can be given _emphasis_, or be made __strong__.
<!--(end)-->

Text can be given _emphasis_, or be made __strong__.


Definitions
===========

Definition lists are handy in a number of circumstances, especially code
documentation. They are declared as follows:

<!--(block | textish)-->
:term This is a definition.
<!--(end)-->

Resulting in something like this:

:term This is a definition.
